You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key.
| If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you
| exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you
| do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.


Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory using
| getwd().

> 
> getwd()

| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir".
| Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command.
| Check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using the file.exists() function.
| Use file.exists("mytest.R") to check that a file exists.
| Access information about the file "mytest.R" by using file.info().
| Change the name of the file "mytest.R" to "mytest2.R" by using file.rename().
Make a copy of "mytest2.R" called "mytest3.R" using file.copy().

> file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")
Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using file.path().
| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the
| operating system your R code is running on. Pass 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to
| file.path to make a platform-independent pathname.
